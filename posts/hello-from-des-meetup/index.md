Hello world from the Dev Edmonton Society's JS/Py/Rb Meetup!

I deployed this post while presenting to a live audience. We covered the basics
of Nikola, and then proceeded to demonstrate the ease of enabling blog-style
posts to a Nikola-built website.

The slides I created for the presentation
[can be found here](/building-websites-with-nikola.pdf). Whether you're a
seasoned web developer; someone coming from a data science, machine learning, or
artificial intelligence background; or just a curious onlooker, I hope Nikola
inspires you to create your first static website.
